Â§ Use many different tools to solve these challenges, you can use the summary lecture to choose between them ðŸ˜‰
Â§ Being within a range 10% above and below the recommended portion means: current > (recommended * 0.90) && current < (recommended * 1.10). Basically, the current portion should be between 90% and 110% of the recommended portion.
